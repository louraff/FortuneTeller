Project Description
---
This is a simple JavaScript program that predicts the future using a random number generator and a set of predefined responses. There are two versions of the program, one written with if...else statements and the other with switch statements.

Installation
---
To install and run the FortuneTeller project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/louraff/FortuneTeller.git
```

2. Change your directory to the project by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cd your-repository
```

Note: If you are using VS Code, you can open the project directly from the application by selecting "Open Folder" and navigating to the cloned repository.

3. To run the fortuneTellerIfElse.js version of the program, paste the following command into your terminal:
```bash
node fortuneTellerIfElse.js
```
This will execute the JavaScript file.

If you want to run the fortuneTellerSwitch.js version of the program, simply replace fortuneTellerIfElse.js with fortuneTellerSwitch.js in the above command.

Usage
---
The program will prompt the user to enter their name and ask a question about their future. It will then generate a random number between 0 and 7 and use it to select a response from the list of predefined answers.

There are two versions of the program: eightball-if-else.js and eightball-switch.js. The first version uses if...else statements to select a response based on the random number, while the second version uses a switch statement.
